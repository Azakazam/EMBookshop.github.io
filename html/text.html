         <h2><u>About Us</u></h2>
         <p>
            This bookshop business started as a result of one of the students discovering that he wanted to <del>steal</del> buy the entire recommended textbook for studies,
            but they are too expensive to buy especially when they are hard covered. He also discovered that there are a lot of past student who have these books which they bought whiles studying, 
            but they do not require them anymore. Some of the books were as good as new and it is just sitting in their book cases doing nothing just taking space.
         </p>
         <p>
            This is when E and M Enterprise was set up to <strong>encourage students</strong> who compete in their course of study and things they would not need their textbooks for,they would sell them to E and M Enterprise
            so that they would sell them towards current students who cannot afford new versions of the textbooks. It was no surprise that from this beginning the business had grown into an SME operating from various 
            educational establishments as a second-hand textbook shop.
         </p>
         <p>
            The bookshop has <b>expanded</b> into various materials used for publishing text such as DVD/CD-ROMs and electronic books; 
            The bookshop's popularity has become one of the places that students look for their books. E and M bookshop is one of the most successful bookshop businesses on the high street!
